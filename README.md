# Human aocial networks may be in equilibrium 
This repository contains the aggregated data necessary to replicate the results in 'Human social networks may be in equilibrium'. Specifically:
- A file containing the abundance of each type of edge in each wave.
- A file containing the abundance of each type of triangle in each wave.
- Eight files containing the abundances of each degree for each one of the eight types of ties with respect to each node.
- Nine files containing the nine transition matrices between edge types, one matrix for each pair of waves.
- Nine files containing the nine transition matrices between triangle types, one matrix for each pair of waves.
- 72 files containing the nine transition matrices between degrees for each one of the eight types of ties with respect to each node, one matrix for each pair of waves.
